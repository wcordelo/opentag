# OpenTag Product — Claude Tag on Cloudflare

Status: **ACTIVE** (authoritative).  
Date: 2026-07-11. Updated: 2026-07-11 (full CF cutover).

## North star

OpenTag is an **open-source Claude Tag alternative**: a Slack-native AI agent you host yourself. Cloudflare is the infrastructure (Workers, Durable Objects, R2, Containers). CopilotKit `@copilotkit/channels` is the bot engine (path-linked from a sibling CopilotKit monorepo until packages publish).

**Acceptance (product):** a production Slack workspace can run the full agent loop — mentions, slash commands, HITL approvals — with durable state across Worker restarts, per-channel prompts, memory, access-controlled tools, and long-running tasks (including deep research).

## Spine

1. **Ingress** — Slack Events API + slash commands + interactions on the **bot Worker** (no Socket Mode).
2. **Bot engine** — `createBot` + `CloudflareSlackAdapter` + `createDurableObjectStore(env.BOT_STATE)` + `HttpAgent` → `AGENT_URL`.
3. **StateStore** (`edge/src/store/`, binding `BOT_STATE`) — durable HITL, turn locks, transcripts, dedup.
4. **Tenant keying** — workspace (`teamId`) with channel overrides.

## Claude Tag parity checklist

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Channel / workspace prompts & config | Implemented (`WorkspaceConfigDO`) |
| Access bundles (tool allowlist + secret *refs*) | Implemented; MCP clients open on Node runtime from refs |
| Memory — thread + knowledge | Implemented (StateStore threadstate + `KnowledgeDO`) |
| Durable HITL | Implemented (createBot ActionStore + Block Kit via Channels) |
| Deep research | Task type via `RESEARCH_TASKS` → orchestrator |
| Bundle → MCP | Runtime opens MCP from context `mcpEndpoints` + env `secretRefs` |
| Multi-agent PM / impl / verify | **Deferred** (Track F) — not in public TaskRuntime API |

## What research is (and is not)

- **Is:** a long-running task (`lib/research/` + research DOs) started by the bot, results posted back to the thread.
- **Is not:** the product surface, the default edge deploy, or the Slack ingress owner.

## Hard invariants

1. No Socket Mode on Cloudflare Workers.
2. Container egress is application-level HTTP proxy only.
3. Task/actor code talks to adapters, not `pg` / raw DO APIs.
4. Cold starts: immediate Slack ack; final result via `chat.postMessage` / agent stream.

## Deploy layout

| Config | Role |
|---|---|
| `edge/wrangler.toml` | **Default** — bot Worker + StateStore + config + knowledge + `RESEARCH_TASKS` |
| `edge/wrangler.research.toml` | Research task Worker (internal `/research`, no public Slack) |
| `edge/workers/egress-proxy/` | Shared egress for containers |

## Remaining work (honest)

- Track F: `pm_impl_verify` / sandbox multi-agent pipeline.
- Publish `@copilotkit/channels*` to npm (today: sibling `file:` checkout).
