# OpenTag: an open-source alternative to Claude in Slack

Run your own AI agent inside Slack: it reads a thread, answers, calls your tools, and
renders rich results right in the conversation. Think of it as having Claude in your
workspace, except **open-source and self-hosted**: you own the runtime, bring your own
model, and wire it to your own tools. No per-seat pricing, no lock-in.

It's built on **[`@copilotkit/bot`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/bot)** —
CopilotKit's open SDK for chat-platform agents (Slack first; the same code also runs on
Discord, Telegram, and WhatsApp). Clone it, point it at your model and tools, and you own
the whole stack.

▶️ **[Watch the demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a74fa1cb-add0-463e-a23c-aa09b95d5135)** (~50s) — an OpenTag agent working a Slack thread: it renders a breakdown, a table, and a bar chart inline (**generative UI**) and files a ticket only after an **Approve** gate (**human-in-the-loop**).

> **Two ways to run it:** **host it on your own** with the open-source SDK below — or skip the ops and **[sign up for the managed service →](https://go.copilotkit.ai/opentag-managed-gh)** coming soon from CopilotKit. The managed service will be part of our Enterprise Intelligence platform. You'll be able to use our cloud-hosting or enterprises can host it on their own infra.

## Quick start (self-hosted)

OpenTag ships inside the [CopilotKit monorepo](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit) as a
first-class example (`examples/slack`). That's the dependable way to run it today while the
bot SDK packages finish publishing to npm. (A standalone `npm install` from this repo lights
up the moment they land — see [setup.md](./setup.md).)

You'll run two processes: the **agent** (the LLM backend) and the **bot** (the Slack
connection) — and set three secrets.

**What you're installing.** OpenTag is built on these CopilotKit packages — `pnpm install` below pulls them in for you; they're listed here so it's clear what's under the hood without clicking through:

- [`@copilotkit/bot`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/bot) — the platform-agnostic bot engine
- [`@copilotkit/bot-slack`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/bot-slack) · [`-discord`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/bot-discord) · [`-telegram`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/bot-telegram) · [`-whatsapp`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/bot-whatsapp) — the platform adapters
- [`@copilotkit/bot-ui`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/bot-ui) — cross-platform JSX for rich messages (Block Kit, Components V2, HTML)
- [`@copilotkit/bot-store-redis`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/bot-store-redis) — optional Redis persistence
- [`@copilotkit/runtime`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/runtime) — the AG-UI agent backend

**1. Create a Slack app.** At [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1) →
*From a manifest* → paste [`slack-app-manifest.yaml`](./slack-app-manifest.yaml). Install it,
then grab the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-…`) and an **App-Level Token** (`xapp-…`, with the
`connections:write` scope). Step-by-step in [setup.md](./setup.md#1-create-a-slack-app).

**2. Set three secrets** in `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`):

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...      # or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY — bring your own model
```

**3. Run it** from the CopilotKit monorepo root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter slack-example runtime   # the agent backend, on :8200
pnpm --filter slack-example dev        # the bot
```

**4. Talk to it.** @mention the bot in any channel thread:

> @OpenTag summarize this thread and file it as a bug

That's the whole loop. To wire up Linear, Notion, inline charts, Redis persistence, or to run
on Discord / Telegram / WhatsApp, see **[setup.md](./setup.md)**.  

We won't lie to you, though. Setting up hosting for chat agents is not easy. To skip all of that heartache, go [join the waitlist](https://go.copilotkit.ai/opentag-managed-gh) for the CopilotKit managed service as part of our Intelligence platform, both cloud-hosted or self-hosted.

## Make it your own

OpenTag is deliberately small and hackable:

- **Change what it does.** The agent's behavior is steered by a single system prompt in
  [`runtime.ts`](./runtime.ts) — rewrite it and you have a different agent.
- **Copy `app/` to start your own bot.** It's the platform-agnostic bot (tools, components, the
  human-in-the-loop gate). `runtime.ts` is the agent backend: one CopilotKit `BuiltInAgent` (an
  LLM + optional MCP tools — no Python, no LangGraph), served over AG-UI.
- **One platform, or all of them.** `createBot` takes an array of adapters; set the secrets for
  whichever platform(s) you want and the bot starts an adapter for each.

The full architecture, the file-by-file map, and every integration live in
**[setup.md](./setup.md)**.

## Don't want to host it yourself?

Self-hosting means you run and scale the runtime, persistence, and inspection tooling yourself.
A **managed CopilotKit service** is on its way. It's the same agent, without the ops: durable
threads, persistence, hosted inspection, and agents that improve from feedback (**Continuous
Learning from Human Feedback**). 

- **[Join the waitlist →](https://go.copilotkit.ai/opentag-managed-gh)** — be first in when the managed service opens.
- **[Talk to an engineer →](https://copilotkit.ai/talk-to-an-engineer)** — building something real on this? We'd love to help you ship it.
