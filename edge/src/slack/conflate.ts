/**
 * Conflates a Chat SDK chunk stream for a slow consumer.
 *
 * Slack rendering pays one rate-limited API call per chunk, while a busy
 * execution can emit tens of thousands of chunks. Without conflation the
 * consumer replays every intermediate state and a large turn can take longer
 * to render than to run. This wrapper drains the source eagerly into a
 * pending snapshot while the consumer is busy:
 *
 * - `markdown_text` deltas are concatenated into one pending chunk (markdown
 *   is append-only content, so merging loses nothing),
 * - `task_update`s are keyed by id and merged per field, newest value
 *   winning. Updates often omit `details`/`output` to mean "unchanged" (the
 *   chunk schema cannot express clearing a field), so absent fields inherit
 *   the pending value instead of dropping content the consumer never sent,
 * - `plan_update` keeps only the latest title.
 *
 * Each consumer pull yields one pending item (plan first, then tasks in
 * first-seen order, then markdown), so the Slack call count is bounded by
 * distinct cards plus markdown volume instead of by source event count.
 * When the consumer keeps up, pending holds at most one item and the stream
 * behaves exactly like the unwrapped source.
